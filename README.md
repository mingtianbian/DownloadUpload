# DownloadUpload (DUL)

## Overview

DownloadUpload (DUL) is a unique project that aims to optimize file transfer by simulating the upload process through high-speed download mechanisms. This approach is particularly useful in environments with asymmetric internet bandwidth, where download speeds significantly exceed upload speeds.

## Key Features

- **Innovative Transfer Mechanism**: Utilizes download capabilities to simulate and achieve upload functionality.
- **Optimized for Asymmetric Bandwidth**: Designed for scenarios where download speeds are much higher than upload speeds.
- **Character-based Data Transfer**: Transmits common characters (letters, numbers, symbols) to represent file content, reducing the need for high upload bandwidth.

## How It Works

1. **File Encoding**: The file content is encoded into a sequence of predefined characters (e.g., A-Z, a-z, 0-9).
2. **Download Simulation**: The client requests the server to download files corresponding to these characters.
3. **File Reconstruction**: The server reconstructs the original file content based on the downloaded character sequence.

## Use Cases

- **Home Networks**: Optimize file transfers in home networks with limited upload speeds but high download speeds.
- **Remote Work**: Enhance productivity by improving file transfer times in remote work setups.
- **Data Synchronization**: Efficiently synchronize data between devices with asymmetric bandwidth.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A server with gigabit upload and download capabilities.
- A client device with gigabit download but limited upload bandwidth.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mingtianbian/DownloadUpload.git
    cd DownloadUpload
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Encode the file content into character sequences.
2. Send download requests to the server.
3. Server reconstructs the file based on the received character sequences.

### Example

```python
# Example script to encode a file and send download requests
from dul import encode_file, send_download_request

file_path = 'path/to/your/file.txt'
character_sequence = encode_file(file_path)

for char in character_sequence:
    send_download_request(char)
